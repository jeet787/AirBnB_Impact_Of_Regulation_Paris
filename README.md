## 📊 Key Insights

1. 📈 **Early Growth Phase** – Listings and prices rose rapidly due to novelty and early adoption.  
2. 🧭 **Market Saturation** – As Airbnb became mainstream, listings grew while prices began to stabilize or decline.  
3. ⚖️ **Regulatory Shock** – Post-regulation, listing numbers dipped and prices surged due to uncertainty.  
4. 🔄 **Regulatory Adaptation** – Once regulations settled, listings rebounded and prices adjusted downward with increased supply.

## 💡 Recommendations

- 🛑 **Monitor Regulatory Trends** – Stay ahead of policy changes in key markets to avoid disruption.  
- 📉 **Mitigate Host & Customer Churn** – Uncertainty can erode trust and brand perception.  
- 🧭 **Replicate Compliance Frameworks** – Use learnings from regulated cities to guide onboarding and host management elsewhere.  
- 📌 **Limit Density** – Cap listings per locality to maintain housing balance and reduce regulatory pressure.  
- ✅ **Strengthen Host Vetting** – Enforce stricter onboarding and listing standards to ensure quality and compliance.
